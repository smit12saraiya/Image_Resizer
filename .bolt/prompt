For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

UI & STYLING:
- Use shadcn/ui components for UI elements (pre-configured with Tailwind CSS)
- Tailwind CSS for custom styling (already configured)
- Use Lucide React for icons (import from 'lucide-react')
- Follow a clean, modern dashboard aesthetic with good spacing and hierarchy

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Support image upload (drag-and-drop + file picker)
- Display extracted data in organized, scannable format
- Show confidence scores and data quality indicators
- Provide clear CTAs for form submission
- Include visual feedback for processing states

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.
